# caesar_cipher
Extended version of ceaser cipher.
Two versions :
1. Ascii only. Can encrypt and decrypt ascii text as well as files. Ignores other characters. Will also include brute force demo in future.
2. Ascii as well as unicode encoded with utf-8. Can encrypt and decrypt text as well as files.


This is just a fun project to implement caesar cipher. As caesar cipher is a primitive and weak cipher, these are not intended for real encryption use cases.
