# caesar_cipher
Extended version of ceaser cipher that supports ASCII encoded in ASNI, as well as ASCII,UNICODE encoded as UTF-8, UTF-16 LE, UTF-16 BE etc.
Encrytion and decryption of text as well as file input.
Key can be explicitly given or randomly selected.
Encrypted files are generated as .cen .
Decrypted files will be generated from .cen files to create .cde files.

Arguments can be passed as both command line or interactively.


This is just a fun project to implement caesar cipher. As caesar cipher is a primitive and weak cipher, these are not intended for real encryption use cases.
