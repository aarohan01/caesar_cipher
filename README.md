# caesar_cipher
Extended version of ceaser cipher.
Two version :
1. Ascii only. Can encrypt and decrypt ascii text as well as files. Ignores other characters.
2. Ascii as well as unicode encoded with utf-8. Can encrypt and decrypt text as well as files.


This is just a fun project to implement caesar cipher. As caesar cipher is a primitive and weak cipher, these are not intended for real encryption use cases.
